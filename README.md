# Unbalanced-Regression-Losses
This github repository contains loss functions that I experimented with for my highly skewed regression problem. It contains codes from other repositories as well some of my own edits/additions.

Tip - To evaluate the benefit of a particular loss function, I prefer to use R-squared and MSE metric.
