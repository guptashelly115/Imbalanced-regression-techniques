# Imbalanced-regression-techniques
Welcome to the imbalanced-regression-techniques repository! This repository is dedicated to compiling various methods and techniques for tackling the challenges posed by imbalanced regression problems. Here, you will find a collection of custom loss function implementations, data transformation techniques, and other strategies designed to improve model performance when dealing with imbalanced regression datasets. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to enhance their models' robustness and accuracy in imbalanced scenarios.

Currently, this github repository contains loss functions that I experimented with for my highly skewed regression problem. It contains codes from other repositories as well some of my own edits/additions. Tip - To evaluate the benefit of a particular loss function, I prefer to use R-squared and MSE metric.
